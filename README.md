 Crag is a dice game where players take turns rolling five six-sided dice, aiming to score points by achieving specific combinations. After each roll, players can choose to set aside dice and roll the remaining ones again, up to three times per turn. They then score points based on the combination they've achieved, selecting from categories such as crag, three of a kind, high straight, low straight. The game continues for a set number of rounds, with the player accumulating the highest total score winning the game. It's a blend of luck and strategy that provides engaging gameplay.
